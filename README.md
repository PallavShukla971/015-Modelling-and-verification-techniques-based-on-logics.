# 015-Modelling-and-verification-techniques-based-on-logics.

Hey everyone, this is a Logical based module, 

also some concepts of Software testing, 

Modeling and verification, 

we are basically sorting out and testing different types of model and then verifying it by testing again and again.

Covered topic in this whole module are like 
-> 1.) Labelled transition systems (LTS), traces, bisimulation
-> 2.) Modelling processes in CSP
-> 3.) Verification of processes using model checking
-> 4.) Modeling and verifying security protocols
-> 5.) Program extraction from proofs
-> 6.) Program Extraction Theorem.

In this Repository we have 3 different departments 

1.)  Lab Assignment -> in which we are using csp language for coding and rest we have pdf which is the explanation of the code, and {[Filename].csp} that is the code files.

-> Lab 3 :  Modelling and analysing security protocols 

-> Lab 3 :  Atacker and Intruder protocol

-> Lab 2 :  The Dining Philosophersâ€™ Problem (Dijkstra 1971)

-> Lab 1 :  Choice and parallelism

2.)  Coursework -> This is base on question in csp language and Program modelling and checking in FDR softwares 

3.) Past Papers -> The most important things in this whole repository are the past papers
